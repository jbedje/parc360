Repository secrets (7)

MONGODB_URI             Updated now by [your-username]
JWT_SECRET              Updated now by [your-username]
REACT_APP_API_URL       Updated now by [your-username]
SSH_PORT                Updated now by [your-username]
SSH_PRIVATE_KEY         Updated now by [your-username]
SSH_USERNAME            Updated now by [your-username]
SSH_HOST                Updated now by [your-username]
```

**If you see all 7**, you're done! ‚úÖ

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ‚ùå Wrong Secret Names
Make sure the names are **EXACTLY** as shown (case-sensitive):
- ‚úÖ `SSH_HOST` - Correct
- ‚ùå `ssh_host` - Wrong
- ‚ùå `SSH_HOST ` - Wrong (extra space)

### ‚ùå Missing BEGIN/END in SSH_PRIVATE_KEY
The private key **MUST** include:
```
-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
[lots of lines]
-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
```

### ‚ùå Extra Spaces or Line Breaks
Copy values **exactly** as they appear in `github-secrets-values.txt`

---

## üß™ Testing the Secrets

Once all 7 secrets are added, test the CI/CD:

### Option 1: Make a Small Change
```bash
# In your terminal
cd C:\Users\JeremieBEDJE\Downloads\PARC360
git commit --allow-empty -m "Test CI/CD deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Watch the Existing Workflow
Go to: https://github.com/jbedje/parc360/actions

Click "Re-run all jobs" on the failed deployment

---

## üéâ What Happens Next

When you push to the `main` branch:

1. **GitHub Actions** will automatically trigger
2. **Build Frontend** - React app will be built
3. **Deploy to Contabo VM** - Code will be deployed via SSH
4. **Restart Services** - PM2 and Nginx will restart
5. **Deployment Complete** - App updated at http://vmi2804403.contaboserver.net

You can watch the progress at: https://github.com/jbedje/parc360/actions

## üîí Security Notes

### After Adding Secrets:

1. **Delete `github-secrets-values.txt`**
   - This file contains sensitive data
   - It's only needed during setup
   - Right-click ‚Üí Delete after you're done

2. **Never Share SSH Private Key**
   - Don't email it
   - Don't post it online
   - Don't commit it to Git

3. **GitHub Secrets Are Safe**
   - GitHub encrypts all secrets
   - They can't be viewed after creation (only updated)
   - They're only available to GitHub Actions

---

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### "I made a typo in a secret name"
- You can delete and re-create the secret
- Click the secret ‚Üí Click "Remove" ‚Üí Add it again

### "I can't see the secret value after adding it"
- This is normal! GitHub hides secret values for security
- If you need to change it, click "Update" on the secret

### "The deployment still fails"
- Check that all 7 secrets are added
- Verify the secret names are exact (case-sensitive)
- Check the Actions tab for specific errors
- Make sure your VM is set up (see `VM_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`)

### "I lost the github-secrets-values.txt file"
- Run `setup-github-secrets.ps1` again
- It will generate a new file with new values
- You'll need to update all secrets in GitHub
